# MongoDB Data Analysis

The purpose of this repository is to practice using MongoDB for data analysis. For this, we are going to use the [IMDB 100,000+ Movies/TvShows
dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kurtnakasato/imdb-100000-moviestvshows?resource=download), available on Kaggle. To do this, we are taking the following steps:

1. Load and manipulate data into a schema more aligned with MongoDB (<em>Data that is accessed together should be stored together</em>)
2. Insert data into MongoDB database
3. Perform an analysis combining MongoDB aggregations an Python

As we intend to practice MongoDB syntax, we are only going to use Python in the last step to visualize results as graphs. No additional data manipulation is done following the aggregation pipeline.
